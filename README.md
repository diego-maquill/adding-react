# Fast-and-Fresh-2

#
For my project-3 I continue working on my eCommerce application for farmers market. The idea was to create a shopping cart for people who want to shop at farmer's market major cities throughout the United States. Most of these farmers market are rotating farmers market and they do not have access to sell through a website application.
